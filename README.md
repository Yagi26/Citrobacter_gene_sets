## Genome data sources

Genome assemblies analyzed in this study were retrieved via
the pubMLST platform and the NCBI Genome database.

The NCBI Genome database was used to screen suitable gene sets
for the identification of <I>Citrobacter</I> species and to characterize
their genetic backgrounds.

The pubMLST platform was used to obtain genomes with curated
isolate metadata and to evaluate the usefulness of the screened
gene sets.

All genome sequences are originally deposited in the
International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC),
including GenBank, ENA, and DDBJ.

Accession numbers and source information are provided in 
metadata/genome_sources.tsv to ensure full <I>traceability</I> and <I>reproducibility</I>.
